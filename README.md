## 📖 Project Context

As a DevOps Engineer, technical skills are mandatory, but the ability to **communicate complex architectures** clearly is what distinguishes a senior professional.

This project is a **Static Web Portfolio** designed to visualize a real-world engineering problem I solved:
*   **The Problem:** A SaaS platform suffering from manual deployment errors and high downtime.
*   **The Solution:** Implementing an automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Nginx Blue-Green deployment.
*   **The Result:** 99.9% Uptime and zero-touch deployments.

## 🎨 Frontend Engineering (The Presentation)

Unlike standard markdown documentation, this case study is presented using a high-performance static website featuring modern web technologies:

*   **✨ Glassmorphism UI:** Translucent, frosted-glass design aesthetics tailored for a modern look.
*   **🌌 Parallax Effects:** Interactive mouse-movement parallax background to create depth and immersion.
*   **⚡ Micro-Interactions:** CSS-only pipeline animations, spotlight hover effects, and scroll-reveal transitions.
*   **📱 Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile devices without using heavy frameworks like React.

## 🛠️ The DevOps Architecture (The Case Study)

The content within the website details the implementation of the following stack:

| Component | Technology | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CI/CD Orchestration** | GitHub Actions | Automated build, test, and push workflows. |
| **Containerization** | Docker | Ensuring environment consistency (IaC). |
| **Traffic Management** | Nginx | Reverse Proxy & Load Balancing (Blue/Green Strategy). |
| **Observability** | Prometheus | Real-time metric scraping and alerting. |
